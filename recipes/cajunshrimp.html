        <h3>Cajun shrimp dinner to impress your peers with</h3>

        <p>This shrimp recipe is loaded with veggies and Cajun spice. We went with bell peppers, onions, and corn, but any stir-fry vegetable would work here.
        Cooking in batches may seem annoying, but prawns cook quickly! You only need about 2 to 3 minutes per side for it to turn pink.</p> 
        <p>BOTTOM LINE: It's not that hard, and it's worth it.</p>
