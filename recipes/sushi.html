        <h3>"A great dish to make if you're going to have friends over who don't like the taste of raw fish"</h3>
        <p>From Lion and Steven Universe on an educational video on their show, "Cooking with Lion".</p>
        <p>Steven visually demonstrates the steps into creating the recipe and talks as Lion by audibly giving the instructions. This continues until the recipe is finished.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Avocado</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Hot sauce</li>
            <li>Sushi rice</li>
            <li>2 sheets of Nori</li>
            <li>1 bag of smooth cheese puffs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a spoon to cut vertical slices into the avocado. Run the spoon along the inside of the skin and transfer the cut slices to a plate.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise and chosen hot sauce and mix them together into its own taste.</li>
            <li>On a bamboo rolling mat, place a sheet of seaweed paper rough-side up and, using a paddle or spatula, spread the sushi rice onto the seaweed paper.</li>
            <li>Line up the avocado slices from earlier onto the sushi rice.</li>
            <li>Cheese puffs. Same as step 4, line them up along the sushi rice with the avocado slices.</li>
            <li>Use the bamboo mat to roll the sushi roll into a cylinder shape.</li>
            <li>Cut the roll into six equally sized pieces so it can be consumed in one bite easily.</li>
            <li>Dip the mixed sauce from earlier onto the top of each piece of sushi and garnish the plate with its own independent sauce for artistry.</li>
        </ol>
